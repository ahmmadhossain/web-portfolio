            <h3>World-class professional web dev</h3>
            <p>I’m Ahmmad Hossain. I’m a designer who codes. I’ve worked internationally, in-house, and remotely on projects for leading brands, agencies, startups, and charities. I care deeply about creating world-class, useful, and beautiful products that help people and make a difference. I can be as involved in your project as you need me to be; from the seed of the idea, to sketches, creative direction, design, copywriting, system design, and even the front-end.</p>

            <h2>Big Dream</h2>
            <h3>Became world's no. 1 Devloper</h3>
            <p>A slight clarification of the above: I’m actually a philosophy student cleverly disguised as a successful web developer. Since it was relatively clear early on that it would be slightly more than difficult to make a living sitting under a tree while reading Kant, I’ve focused my energies on the web, which happily has proven itself to be a wonderful decision.</p>
